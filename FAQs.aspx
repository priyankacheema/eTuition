Of course, Yes. It is one of the many services of the faculty. Please be 
informed that it is our endeavour to impart knowledge to make the students do 
their work rather than undertaking to &#39;outsource&#39; it.<br />
<br />
<b>How can eTuitions guarantee that my son is attending with involvement while 
he has always been complained of &#39;inattendiveness&#39; in real classroom by his 
class teacher?</b><br />
<br />
Quite a good number of students in normal classrooms sit silently and passively, 
paying no attention and learning nothing. The situation is no different in a 
large coaching class. Such students cause no hindrance, most tutors don&#39;t 
bother.<br />
<br />
On the contrary, if such students were actually sitting down for a learning 
session with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;

different. It is largely interactive in nature and our pages are designed to 
stimulate and excite. The interactive features will be a powerful force to keep 
all the students participating and enjoying their lessons.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Does it cost more to get tuitions online?</b><br />
In fact, it is not. Many parents fear that online tuitions may cost high. Please 
consider the amounts you spend sending your child to a coaching class, Fees plus 
the cost of travel, guides, self-study books, frequent cancellations, road 
safety etc., then eTuitions cost is relatively very low and safe.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a parent you always wanted to provide your child the best and safest, you 
should have already realized that computers are an indispensable part of life. 
What&#39;s more, the prices of computers have fallen drastically, and so is the cost 
of connectivity. Some internet subscriptions are already virtually free.

<br />
<b>My Son is very shy in the class and always hesitant to ask questions? Will 
online tuitions help him anyway?</b>&nbsp;<br />
Very much. It has been extensively proved that through online tuitions students 
tend to gain more self confidence and are more actively involved in it. Many of 
the students feel shy in normal classrooms whereas in online tuitions they put 
forward their doubts without any shy. In natural progression, the 
self-confidence achieved by attending online classes will be reflected in their 
regular classrooms as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Can I pay the fees in Installments (Deferred Payments) ?</b>&nbsp;<br />
Of Course, Yes. We have flexible payment schemes to ensure that you don’t find 
it difficult.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Can I enroll for multiple courses at different timings?</b>&nbsp;<br />
Yes Sure. This is a major advantage of online tutoring – you need not have to 
commute to attend the classes, therefore you can attend classes at your 
convenient timings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>If student is not satisfied with the faculty how should that be communicated, 
will the fees be repaid?</b>&nbsp;<br />
We have stringent selection process to ensure that we have the best faculties, 
therefore this situation is very unlikely. In the rarest situation if the 
student does not wish to continue with the faculty, this has to be informed to 
the Course co-coordinator and in the shortest possible time we will arrange 
alternative faculty. It is our organization policy to make sure that student’s 
interests are safeguarded and under no circumstances the fees once paid will be 
repaid.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>I enrolled my daughter last year for Std IX and would like to enroll for the 
Std X this year – should we re-register all again to attend this year’s classes?</b>&nbsp;<br />
No need at all. Whatever enrollment details entered always stays in our Database 
and with the last year’s enrollment number please send an email to 
enroll@etuitions.org mentioning the course to be attended this year. We will 
send details for fees payment, as soon as the fees payment is made we will 
activate the enrollment number and send the schedule for attending the classes 
for current academic course.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>We don’t have Internet connection at our home can I ask my son to go to 
Internet café to attend the eTuitions?</b>&nbsp;<br />
Definitely this is possible, but we advice parents to provide the right 
environment at their home itself by getting the Internet broadband connection, 
which is available at very nominal cost.</span>
